# LEGAL NOTE
_In light of all web-based Taiko simulators being taken down due to a copyright claim, I thought I'd mention this._  

This project is in no way meant to infringe on the copyright of Bandai Namco nor anyone affiliated with them and the game Taiko no Tatsujin.
This project was made purely for educational purposes, and is also in no way meant to be a full simulator, as it is rather just a proof-of-concept
and a funny task I got in my head because I was bored.  
Please do not take this project down due to a copyright claim, I'm just messing around with coding here.

# Song link screen
_This time from the technical perspective._  
_See the UI documentation [here](doc/ui/songlink.md)!_

## Link button
Already selected by default, requires a P1 click to activate.
+ Waits 3 seconds, then disables the button and skips to the next screen.
+ When activated, stops the countdown, rolls down a panel showing the song link, and kills the player afterwards.
